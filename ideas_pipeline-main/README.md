# ideas_pipelilne

This folder hosts scRNA-seq data from prefrontal cortex (PFC) region of both autism patients and healthy controls (Velmeshev et al., 2019). Additionally, the folder contains source code required for the DCA-IDEAS method, which is discussed in Zhang et al. (2022). The source code used in this context was adapted from the [ideas_pipelilne](https://github.com/Sun-lab/ideas_pipeline/tree/main/Autism) (Zhang et al., 2022).
